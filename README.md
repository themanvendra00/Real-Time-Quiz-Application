## Usage

3. **Gameplay**: Once two players are in the same room, they will receive quiz questions in real-time. Each user has a 10-second window to respond with their answers. Correct answers are awarded 10 points.

4. **Game Conclusion**: The game concludes after collecting responses for 5 questions or after 50 seconds, whichever comes first. The result is broadcast to both users. Once the game concludes, the respective room is closed and deleted.
